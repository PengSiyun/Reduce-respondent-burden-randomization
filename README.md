# For similation: 
Run "Randomization-Alter-Simulated data-varied" first, which produce results for proportion of often contact

Then run "Randomization-Simulated data-varied", which produce results for density and produce combined figures for similation
# For Real-world sample: 
Run "Randomization_SNAD"
# For Figure of ties by network size (Figure 1)
Run "growth of ties by netsize"
