# Reduce-respondent-burden-randomization
# For similation: 
Run "Randomization-Alter-Simulated data-varied" first, which produce results for proportion of often contact
then run "Randomization-Simulated data-varied", which produce results for density
# For Real-world sample: 
Run "Randomization_SNAD".
# For Figure of ties by network size (Figure 1)
Run "growth of ties by netsize"
